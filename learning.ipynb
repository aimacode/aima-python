    "## MACHINE LEARNING OVERVIEW\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we learn about agents that can improve their behavior through diligent study of their own experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "An agent is **learning** if it improves its performance on future tasks after making observations about the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three types of feedback that determine the three main types of learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Supervised Learning**:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Supervised Learning the agent observes some example input-output pairs and learns a function that maps from input to output.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: Let's think of an agent to classify images containing cats or dogs. If we provide an image containing a cat or a dog, this agent should output a string \"cat\" or \"dog\" for that particular image. To teach this agent, we will give a lot of input-output pairs like {cat image-\"cat\"}, {dog image-\"dog\"} to the agent. The agent then learns a function that maps from an input image to one of those strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Unsupervised Learning**:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Unsupervised Learning the agent learns patterns in the input even though no explicit feedback is supplied. The most common type is **clustering**: detecting potential useful clusters of input examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: A taxi agent would develop a concept of *good traffic days* and *bad traffic days* without ever being given labeled examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reinforcement Learning**:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Reinforcement Learning the agent learns from a series of reinforcements—rewards or punishments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: Let's talk about an agent to play the popular Atari game—[Pong](http://www.ponggame.org). We will reward a point for every correct move and deduct a point for every wrong move from the agent. Eventually, the agent will figure out its actions prior to reinforcement were most responsible for it."

    "* [Fisher's Iris](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-data/blob/a21fc108f52ad551344e947b0eb97df82f8d2b2b/iris.csv): Each item represents a flower, with four measurements: the length and the width of the sepals and petals. Each item/flower is categorized into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica.\n",

    "* [Zoo](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-data/blob/a21fc108f52ad551344e947b0eb97df82f8d2b2b/zoo.csv): The dataset holds different animals and their classification as \"mammal\", \"fish\", etc. The new animal we want to classify has the following measurements: 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 4, 1, 0, 1 (don't concern yourself with what the measurements mean)."

It finds the most popular class in the dataset and classifies any subsequent item to that class. Essentially, it classifies every new item to the same class. For that reason, it is not used very often, instead opting for more complicated algorithms when we want accurate classification.\n",

Every point in this plot has two **features** (i.e. X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>). Now, let's say we have a new point, a red star and we want to know which class this red star belongs to. Solving this problem by predicting the class of this new red star is our current classification problem.\n",

    "### Overview\n",

    "#### Decision Trees\n",
    "A decision tree is a flowchart that uses a tree of decisions and their possible consequences for classification. At each non-leaf node of the tree an attribute of the input is tested, based on which corresponding branch leading to a child-node is selected. At the leaf node the input is classified based on the class label of this leaf node. The paths from root to leaves represent classification rules based on which leaf nodes are assigned class labels.\n",
    "![perceptron](images/decisiontree_fruit.jpg)\n",
    "#### Decision Tree Learning\n",
    "Decision tree learning is the construction of a decision tree from class-labeled training data. The data is expected to be a tuple in which each record of the tuple is an attribute used for classification. The decision tree is built top-down, by choosing a variable at each step that best splits the set of items. There are different metrics for measuring the \"best split\". These generally measure the homogeneity of the target variable within the subsets.\n",

    "We have a dataset with a set of classes (**C**) and we want to classify an item with a set of features (**F**). Essentially what we want to do is predict the class of an item given the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a specific class, **Class**, we will find the conditional probability given the item features:\n",

    "\n",
    "We will do this for every class and we will pick the maximum. This will be the class the item is classified in.\n",
    "\n",
    "The features though are a vector with many elements. We need to break the probabilities up using the multiplication rule. Thus the above equation becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(Class|F) = \\dfrac{P(Class)*P(F_{1}|Class)*P(F_{2}|Class)*...*P(F_{n}|Class)}{P(F_{1})*P(F_{2})*...*P(F_{n})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculation of the conditional probability then depends on the calculation of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "*a)* The probability of **Class** in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "*b)* The conditional probability of each feature occurring in an item classified in **Class**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*c)* The probabilities of each individual feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "For *a)*, we will count how many times **Class** occurs in the dataset (aka how many items are classified in a particular class).\n",
    "\n",
    "For *b)*, if the feature values are discrete ('Blue', '3', 'Tall', etc.), we will count how many times a feature value occurs in items of each class. If the feature values are not discrete, we will go a different route. We will use a distribution function to calculate the probability of values for a given class and feature. If we know the distribution function of the dataset, then great, we will use it to compute the probabilities. If we don't know the function, we can assume the dataset follows the normal (Gaussian) distribution without much loss of accuracy. In fact, it can be proven that any distribution tends to the Gaussian the larger the population gets (see [Central Limit Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem)).\n",
    "\n",
    "*NOTE:* If the values are continuous but use the discrete approach, there might be issues if we are not lucky. For one, if we have two values, '5.0 and 5.1', with the discrete approach they will be two completely different values, despite being so close. Second, if we are trying to classify an item with a feature value of '5.15', if the value does not appear for the feature, its probability will be 0. This might lead to misclassification. Generally, the continuous approach is more accurate and more useful, despite the overhead of calculating the distribution function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last one, *c)*, is tricky. If feature values are discrete, we can count how many times they occur in the dataset. But what if the feature values are continuous? Imagine a dataset with a height feature. Is it worth it to count how many times each value occurs? Most of the time it is not, since there can be miscellaneous differences in the values (for example, 1.7 meters and 1.700001 meters are practically equal, but they count as different values).\n",
    "\n",
    "So as we cannot calculate the feature value probabilities, what are we going to do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a step back and rethink exactly what we are doing. We are essentially comparing conditional probabilities of all the classes. For two classes, **A** and **B**, we want to know which one is greater:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dfrac{P(F|A)*P(A)}{P(F)} vs. \\dfrac{P(F|B)*P(B)}{P(F)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, **P(F)** is the same for both the classes! In fact, it is the same for every combination of classes. That is because **P(F)** does not depend on a class, thus being independent of the classes.\n",
