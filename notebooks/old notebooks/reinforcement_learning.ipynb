    "## OVERVIEW\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start playing with the actual implementations let us review a couple of things about RL.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reinforcement Learning is concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Reinforcement learning differs from standard supervised learning in that correct input/output pairs are never presented, nor sub-optimal actions explicitly corrected. Further, there is a focus on on-line performance, which involves finding a balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current knowledge).\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning)\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary we have a sequence of state action transitions with rewards associated with some states. Our goal is to find the optimal policy $\\pi$ which tells us what action to take in each state."

   "source": [
    "## PASSIVE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING\n",
    "\n",
    "In passive Reinforcement Learning the agent follows a fixed policy $\\pi$. Passive learning attempts to evaluate the given policy $pi$ - without any knowledge of the Reward function $R(s)$ and the Transition model $P(s'\\ |\\ s, a)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is usually done by some method of **utility estimation**. The agent attempts to directly learn the utility of each state that would result from following the policy. Note that at each step, it has to *perceive* the reward and the state - it has no global knowledge of these. Thus, if a certain the entire set of actions offers a very low probability of attaining some state $s_+$ - the agent may never perceive the reward $R(s_+)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a situation where an agent is given a policy to follow. Thus, at any point it knows only its current state and current reward, and the action it must take next. This action may lead it to more than one state, with different probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a series of actions given by $\\pi$, the estimated utility $U$:\n",
    "$$U^{\\pi}(s) = E(\\sum_{t=0}^\\inf \\gamma^t R^t(s')$$)\n",
    "Or the expected value of summed discounted rewards until termination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this concept, we discuss three methods of estimating utility:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Direct Utility Estimation (DUE)**\n",
    " \n",
    " The first, most naive method of estimating utility comes from the simplest interpretation of the above definition. We construct an agent that follows the policy until it reaches the terminal state. At each step, it logs its current state, reward. Once it reaches the terminal state, it can estimate the utility for each state for *that* iteration, by simply summing the discounted rewards from that state to the terminal one.\n",
    "\n",
    " It can now run this 'simulation' $n$ times, and calculate the average utility of each state. If a state occurs more than once in a simulation, both its utility values are counted separately.\n",
    " \n",
    " Note that this method may be prohibitively slow for very large statespaces. Besides, **it pays no attention to the transition probability $P(s'\\ |\\ s, a)$.** It misses out on information that it is capable of collecting (say, by recording the number of times an action from one state led to another state). The next method addresses this issue.\n",
    " \n",
    "2. **Adaptive Dynamic Programming (ADP)**\n",
    " \n",
    " This method makes use of knowledge of the past state $s$, the action $a$, and the new perceived state $s'$ to estimate the transition probability $P(s'\\ |\\ s,a)$. It does this by the simple counting of new states resulting from previous states and actions.<br> \n",
    " The program runs through the policy a number of times, keeping track of:\n",
    "    - each occurrence of state $s$ and the policy-recommended action $a$ in $N_{sa}$\n",
    "    - each occurrence of $s'$ resulting from $a$ on $s$ in $N_{s'|sa}$.\n",
    "     \n",
    " It can thus estimate $P(s'\\ |\\ s,a)$ as $N_{s'|sa}/N_{sa}$, which in the limit of infinite trials, will converge to the true value.<br>\n",
    " Using the transition probabilities thus estimated, it can apply `POLICY-EVALUATION` to estimate the utilities $U(s)$ using properties of convergence of the Bellman functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Temporal-difference learning (TD)**\n",
    " \n",
    " Instead of explicitly building the transition model $P$, the temporal-difference model makes use of the expected closeness between the utilities of two consecutive states $s$ and $s'$.\n",
    " For the transition $s$ to $s'$, the update is written as:\n",
    "$$U^{\\pi}(s) \\leftarrow U^{\\pi}(s) + \\alpha \\left( R(s) + \\gamma U^{\\pi}(s') - U^{\\pi}(s) \\right)$$\n",
    " This model implicitly incorporates the transition probabilities by being weighed for each state by the number of times it is achieved from the current state. Thus, over a number of iterations, it converges similarly to the Bellman equations.\n",
    " The advantage of the TD learning model is its relatively simple computation at each step, rather than having to keep track of various counts.\n",
    " For $n_s$ states and $n_a$ actions the ADP model would have $n_s \\times n_a$ numbers $N_{sa}$ and $n_s^2 \\times n_a$ numbers $N_{s'|sa}$ to keep track of. The TD model must only keep track of a utility $U(s)$ for each state."

    "\n",
    "The `Agent-Program` can be obtained by creating an instance of the relevant `Agent-Class`. The `__call__` method allows the `Agent-Class` to be called as a function. The class needs to be instantiated with a policy ($\\pi$) and an `MDP` whose utility of states will be estimated."
