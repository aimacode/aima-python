In fact, with enough data we can categorize correctly mostly any text. That is because different languages have certain characteristics that set them apart. For example, in German it is very usual for 'c' to be followed by 'h' while in English we see 't' followed by 'h' a lot.\n",

    "We know that computers are great with numbers but they cannot work out with the natural language. So in order to overcome the problem, the text is converted to numbers for analysis. One of the most common and popular techniques for this is TF-IDF which stands for Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **TF(Term Frequency):-** Gives the frequency of each word in a document. As the number of occurrences of a word increases in a document its value increases for that document. Basically, if a word appears more times in a document then that word is important to that document.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **TF(t) = (Number of times term t appears in a document) / (Total number of terms in the document)**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **IDF(Inverse Document Frequency):-** The Inverse Document Frequency is a measure of how much information the word provides, i.e., if it's common or rare across all documents. It calculates how much a word is important for a given set of document. The words that occur in fewer documents are more important compared to the words that occur in more documents. It helps to find the important words across the documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **IDF(t) = log( (Total number of documents) / (1 + Number of documents with term t in it ))**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    (1 is added to the base for coding purposes. It helps to deal with the cases when the term does not appear in any document. The fraction term in the log would have a denominator of zero. So in order to prevent division by zero 1 is added in the denominator.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*TF-IDF* finally gives the importance of a single word in a collection of documents by multiplying the TF of that word in that document with the IDF of that word across the documents.\n",

    "#### Working with TF-IDF  \n",

    "5. The relevance of a word can be calculated using `get_tf_idf_score(word, doc)` function. \n",
    "6. Using this object we can get the `n` most important words of the document using `top(doc, n)` function.\n",
    "7. We can see the TF-IDF vector 'i.e. score of all the words in the document' by `tf_idf_vector(doc)`.\n",
