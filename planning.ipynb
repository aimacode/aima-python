    "## Representations For Planning:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **STRIPS** \n",
    "The simplest language used for formalizing actions is the STRIPS language. In STRIPS, the state variables have the domain {0,1} (equivalently {FALSE, TRUE}), and an action consists of three sets of state variables, the PRECONDITION, the ADD={a1,a2,...,an} list, and the DELETE={d1,d2,...,dm} list (it is assumed that ADD and DELETE don't intersect.) \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **ADL**\n",
    "Action description language (ADL) is an automated planning and scheduling system in particular for robots. It is considered an advancement of STRIPS. We won't go ino its details here.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **PDDL**\n",
    "(\"Planning Domain Definition Language\") is a recent atempt to standardize planning domain and problem description languages. It was developed mainly to make the 1998/2000 International Planning Competitions possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "The differences of PDDL in comparison to STRIPS are:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The PRECONDITION may be an arbitrary Boolean combination of atomic facts about the state variables. Atomic facts say something about one state variable, for example a=0 or b=1. A precondition could for example be (a=1)∨¬(b=1∧c=0).\n",
    "  - Instead of the unconditional assignments represented by ADD and DELETE, the effects may be conditional. This means that the effects are of the form, IF condition THEN a := v where the condition is a Boolean combination of facts. STRIPS corresponds to PDDL with trivial conditions that are always true (the condition is the constant TRUE).\n",
    "  - Goals may be Boolean combinations of atomic facts (formulas). \n",

    "4. The goal test\n",

    "\n",
    "The `PDDL class` includes:\n",
