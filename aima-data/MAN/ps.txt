NAME
       ps - report process status

SYNOPSIS
       ps [options]


DESCRIPTION
       ps  gives a snapshot of the current processes. If you want a repetitive
       update of this status, use top. This man page documents the /proc-based
       version of ps, or tries to.


COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS
       This version of ps accepts several kinds of options.
	      Unix98 options may be grouped and must be preceeded by a dash.
	      BSD options may be grouped and must not be used with a dash.
	      GNU long options are preceeded by two dashes.
       Options of different types may be freely mixed.

       Set  the	 I_WANT_A_BROKEN_PS  environment  variable to force BSD syntax
       even when options are preceeded by a dash. The PS_PERSONALITY  environ-
       ment  variable  (described  below) provides more detailed control of ps
       behavior.

   OBSOLETE
       Switch	Description
       ()									   ()



       A	increase the argument space (DecUnix)
       M	use alternate core (try -n or N instead)
       W	get swap info from ... not /dev/drum (try -n or N instead)
       k	use /vmcore as c-dumpfile (try -n or N instead)


NOTES
       The  "-g" option can select by session leader OR by group name.	Selec-
       tion by session leader is specified by many standards, but selection by
       group is the logical behavior that several other operating systems use.
       This ps will select by session  leader  when  the  list	is  completely
       numeric	(as  sessions  are). Group ID numbers will work only when some
       group names are also specified.

       The "m" option should not be used. Use "-m" or "-o" with a list.	  ("m"
       displays memory info, shows threads, or sorts by memory use)

       The  "h"	 option	 is  problematic.   Standard BSD ps uses the option to
       print a header on each page of output, but  older  Linux	 ps  uses  the
       option  to  totally disable the header.	This version of ps follows the
       Linux usage of not printing the header unless the BSD  personality  has
       been selected, in which case it prints a header on each page of output.
       Regardless of the current personality, you can  use  the	 long  options
       --headers  and  --no-headers  to	 enable printing headers each page and
       disable headers entirely, respectively.

       Terminals (ttys, or screens of text output) can be specified in several
       forms:  /dev/ttyS1,  ttyS1, S1. Obsolete "ps t" (your own terminal) and
       "ps t?" (processes without a terminal) syntax is supported, but	modern
       options	("T",  "-t"  with  list,  "x",	"t"  with list) should be used
       instead.

       The BSD "O" option can act like "-O" (user-defined output  format  with
       some  common  fields  predefined) or can be used to specify sort order.
       Heuristics are used to determine the behavior of this option. To ensure
       that  the desired behavior is obtained, specify the other option (sort-
       ing or formatting) in some other way.

       For sorting, BSD "O" option syntax is  O[+|-]k1[,[+|-]k2[,...]]	 Order
       the  process  listing according to the multilevel sort specified by the
       sequence of short keys from SORT KEYS, k1, k2, ...  The	`+'  is	 quite
       optional,  merely  re-iterating	the  default  direction	 on a key. `-'
       reverses direction only on the key it precedes. The O  option  must  be
       the  last  option  in  a single command argument, but specifications in
       successive arguments are catenated.

       GNU sorting syntax is --sortX[+|-]key[,[+|-]key[,...]]  Choose a multi-
       letter  key from the SORT KEYS section. X may be any convenient separa-
       tor character. To be GNU-ish use `='. The `+' is really optional	 since
       default	direction  is increasing numerical or lexicographic order. For
       example, ps jax --sort=uid,-ppid,+pid

       This ps works by reading the virtual files in /proc. This ps  does  not
       need to be suid kmem or have any privileges to run. Do not give this ps
       any special permissions.

       This ps needs access to a namelist file for proper WCHAN display.   The
       namelist	 file  must match the current Linux kernel exactly for correct
       output.

       To produce the WCHAN field, ps needs to read the System.map  file  cre-
       ated when the kernel is compiled. The search path is:
	      $PS_SYSTEM_MAP
	      /boot/System.map-`uname -r`
	      /boot/System.map
	      /lib/modules/`uname -r`/System.map
	      /usr/src/linux/System.map
	      /System.map
       The  member  used_math of task_struct is not shown, since crt0.s checks
       to see if math is present. This causes the math flag to be set for  all
       processes,  and	so  it	is worthless. (Somebody fix libc or the kernel
       please.)

       Programs swapped out to disk will be shown without command  line	 argu-
       ments, and unless the c option is given, in brackets.

       %CPU  shows the cputime/realtime percentage. It will not add up to 100%
       unless you are lucky. It is time used divided by the time  the  process
       has been running.

       The SIZE and RSS fields don't count the page tables and the task_struct
       of a proc; this is at least 12k of memory that is always resident. SIZE
       is the virtual size of the proc (code+data+stack).

       Processes  marked  <defunct>  are  dead processes (so-called "zombies")
       that remain because their parent has not destroyed them properly. These
       processes will be destroyed by init(8) if the parent process exits.


   PROCESS FLAGS
       FORKNOEXEC   1	forked but didn't exec
       SUPERPRIV    2	used super-user privileges
       DUMPCORE	    4	dumped core


   PROCESS STATE CODES
       D   uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)

       R   runnable (on run queue)
       S   sleeping
       T   traced or stopped
       Z   a defunct ("zombie") process

       For BSD formats and when the "stat" keyword is used, additional letters
       may be displayed:

       W   has no resident pages
       <   high-priority process
       N   low-priority task
       L   has pages locked into memory (for real-time and custom IO)


   SORT KEYS
       Note that the values used in sorting are the internal  values  ps  uses
       and  not	 the `cooked' values used in some of the output format fields.
       Pipe ps output into the sort(1) command if you want to sort the	cooked
       values.

   AIX FORMAT DESCRIPTORS
       This  ps	 supports AIX format descriptors, which work somewhat like the
       formatting codes of printf(1) and printf(3). For	 example,  the	normal
       default output can be produced with this:   ps -eo "%p %y %x %c"

   ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following environment variables could affect ps:

       COLUMNS		    Override default display width
       LINES		    Override default display height
       PS_PERSONALITY	    Set to one of posix,old,linux,bsd,sun,digital
       CMD_ENV		    Set to one of posix,old,linux,bsd,sun,digital
       I_WANT_A_BROKEN_PS   Force obsolete command line interpretation
       LC_TIME		    Date format
       PS_FORMAT	    Default output format override
       PS_SYSMAP	    Default namelist (System.map) location
       PS_SYSTEM_MAP	    Default namelist (System.map) location
       POSIXLY_CORRECT	    Don't find excuses to ignore bad "features"
       UNIX95		    Don't find excuses to ignore bad "features"
       _XPG		    Cancel CMD_ENV=irix non-standard behavior

       In general, it is a bad idea to set these variables. The two exceptions
       are CMD_ENV (or PS_PERSONALITY), to set the desired  default  personal-
       ity,  and  POSIXLY_CORRECT  (or UNIX95), which should be set for Unix98
       standard compliance.

       ps was originally written by Branko Lankester <lankeste@fwi.uva.nl>.
       Michael K. Johnson <johnsonm@redhat.com> re-wrote it  significantly  to
       use the proc filesystem, changing a few things in the process.
       Michael Shields <shields@msrl.com> added the pid-list feature.
       Charles	Blake  <cblake@bbn.com> added multi-level sorting, the dirent-
       style library, the device name-to-number mmaped database, the  approxi-
       mate binary search directly on System.map, and many code and documenta-
       tion cleanups.
       David Mosberger-Tang wrote the generic BFD support for psupdate.
       Albert Cahalan <acahalan@cs.uml.edu> rewrote ps for full Unix98 and BSD
       support, along with some ugly hacks for obsolete and foreign syntax.

       Michael K. Johnson <johnsonm@redhat.com> is the current maintainer.
