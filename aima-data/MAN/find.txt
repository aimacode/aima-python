NAME
       find - search for files in a directory hierarchy

SYNOPSIS
       find [path...] [expression]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual page documents the GNU version of find.  find searches the
       directory tree rooted at each given file name by evaluating  the	 given
       expression  from	 left  to  right, according to the rules of precedence
       (see section OPERATORS), until the outcome is known (the left hand side
       is false for and operations, true for or), at which point find moves on
       to the next file name.

       The first argument that begins with `-', `(', `)', `,', or `!' is taken
       to  be  the  beginning  of  the expression; any arguments before it are
       paths to search, and any arguments after it are the rest of the expres-
       sion.   If  no  paths  are given, the current directory is used.	 If no
       expression is given, the expression `-print' is used.

       find exits with status 0	 if  all  files	 are  processed	 successfully,
       greater than 0 if errors occur.

EXPRESSIONS
       The  expression	is  made up of options (which affect overall operation
       rather than the processing of a specific file, and always return true),
       tests  (which  return  a	 true or false value), and actions (which have
       side effects and return a true or false value), all separated by opera-
       tors.   -and  is assumed where the operator is omitted.	If the expres-
       sion contains no actions other than -prune, -print is performed on  all
       files for which the expression is true.

   OPTIONS
       All  options  always return true.  They always take effect, rather than
       being processed only when their place in	 the  expression  is  reached.
       Therefore,  for	clarity,  it is best to place them at the beginning of
       the expression.

       -daystart
	      Measure times (for -amin,	 -atime,  -cmin,  -ctime,  -mmin,  and
	      -mtime)  from  the  beginning of today rather than from 24 hours
	      ago.

       -depth Process each directory's contents before the directory itself.

       -follow
	      Dereference symbolic links.  Implies -noleaf.

       -help, --help
	      Print a summary of the command-line usage of find and exit.

       -maxdepth levels
	      Descend at most levels (a non-negative integer) levels of direc-
	      tories  below  the  command line arguments.  `-maxdepth 0' means
	      only apply the tests and actions to the command line  arguments.

       -mindepth levels
	      Do  not apply any tests or actions at levels less than levels (a
	      non-negative integer).  `-mindepth 1' means  process  all	 files
	      except the command line arguments.

       -mount Don't  descend  directories  on other filesystems.  An alternate
	      name for -xdev, for compatibility with some  other  versions  of
	      find.

       -noleaf
	      Do  not  optimize	 by  assuming that directories contain 2 fewer
	      subdirectories than their	 hard  link  count.   This  option  is
	      needed  when  searching  filesystems that do not follow the Unix
	      directory-link convention, such as CD-ROM or MS-DOS  filesystems
	      or  AFS  volume  mount  points.  Each directory on a normal Unix
	      filesystem has at least 2 hard  links:  its  name	 and  its  `.'
	      entry.   Additionally,  its  subdirectories (if any) each have a
	      `..'  entry linked to that directory.  When find is examining  a
	      directory,  after it has statted 2 fewer subdirectories than the
	      directory's link count, it knows that the rest of the entries in
	      the directory are non-directories (`leaf' files in the directory
	      tree).  If only the files' names need to be examined,  there  is
	      no  need	to  stat  them;	 this  gives a significant increase in
	      search speed.

       -version, --version
	      Print the find version number and exit.

       -xdev  Don't descend directories on other filesystems.

   TESTS
       Numeric arguments can be specified as

       +n     for greater than n,

       -n     for less than n,

       n      for exactly n.

       -amin n
	      File was last accessed n minutes ago.

       -anewer file
	      File was last accessed more recently  than  file	was  modified.
	      -anewer  is  affected  by	 -follow  only if -follow comes before
	      -anewer on the command line.

       -atime n
	      File was last accessed n*24 hours ago.

       -cmin n
	      File's status was last changed n minutes ago.

       -cnewer file
	      File's status was last changed more recently than file was modi-
	      fied.   -cnewer  is  affected  by	 -follow only if -follow comes
	      before -cnewer on the command line.

       -ctime n
	      File's status was last changed n*24 hours ago.

       -empty File is empty and is either a regular file or a directory.

       -false Always false.

       -fstype type
	      File is on a filesystem of  type	type.	The  valid  filesystem
	      types  vary among different versions of Unix; an incomplete list
	      of filesystem types that are accepted on some version of Unix or
	      another  is:  ufs, 4.2, 4.3, nfs, tmp, mfs, S51K, S52K.  You can
	      use -printf with the %F directive	 to  see  the  types  of  your
	      filesystems.

       -gid n File's numeric group ID is n.

       -group gname
	      File belongs to group gname (numeric group ID allowed).

       -ilname pattern
	      Like -lname, but the match is case insensitive.

       -iname pattern
	      Like -name, but the match is case insensitive.  For example, the
	      patterns `fo*' and `F??' match  the  file	 names	`Foo',	`FOO',
	      `foo', `fOo', etc.

       -inum n
	      File has inode number n.

       -ipath pattern
	      Like -path, but the match is case insensitive.

       -iregex pattern
	      Like -regex, but the match is case insensitive.

       -links n
	      File has n links.

       -lname pattern
	      File  is a symbolic link whose contents match shell pattern pat-
	      tern.  The metacharacters do not treat `/' or `.' specially.

       -mmin n
	      File's data was last modified n minutes ago.

       -mtime n
	      File's data was last modified n*24 hours ago.

       -name pattern
	      Base of  file  name  (the	 path  with  the  leading  directories
	      removed)	matches	 shell	pattern	 pattern.   The metacharacters
	      (`*', `?', and `[]') do not match a `.' at the start of the base
	      name.  To ignore a directory and the files under it, use -prune;
	      see an example in the description of -path.

       -newer file
	      File was modified more recently than file.  -newer  is  affected
	      by  -follow  only	 if -follow comes before -newer on the command
	      line.

       -nouser
	      No user corresponds to file's numeric user ID.

       -nogroup
	      No group corresponds to file's numeric group ID.

       -path pattern
	      File name matches shell pattern pattern.	The metacharacters  do
	      not treat `/' or `.' specially; so, for example,
			find . -path './sr*sc'
	      will  print an entry for a directory called './src/misc' (if one
	      exists).	To ignore a whole directory tree,  use	-prune	rather
	      than  checking every file in the tree.  For example, to skip the
	      directory `src/emacs' and all files and  directories  under  it,
	      and  print the names of the other files found, do something like
	      this:
			find . -path './src/emacs' -prune -o -print

       -perm mode
	      File's permission bits are exactly  mode	(octal	or  symbolic).
	      Symbolic modes use mode 0 as a point of departure.

       -perm -mode
	      All of the permission bits mode are set for the file.

       -perm +mode
	      Any of the permission bits mode are set for the file.

       -regex pattern
	      File  name  matches regular expression pattern.  This is a match
	      on the whole path, not a search.	For example, to match  a  file
	      named `./fubar3', you can use the regular expression `.*bar.' or
	      `.*b.*3', but not `b.*r3'.

       -size n[bckw]
	      File uses n units of space.  The units are  512-byte  blocks  by
	      default  or  if `b' follows n, bytes if `c' follows n, kilobytes
	      if `k' follows n, or 2-byte words if `w' follows	n.   The  size
	      does  not	 count	indirect  blocks,  but it does count blocks in
	      sparse files that are not actually allocated.

       -true  Always true.

       -type c
	      File is of type c:

	      b	     block (buffered) special

	      c	     character (unbuffered) special

	      d	     directory

	      p	     named pipe (FIFO)

	      f	     regular file

	      l	     symbolic link

	      s	     socket

	      D	     door (Solaris)

       -uid n File's numeric user ID is n.

       -used n
	      File was last accessed n days after its status was last changed.

       -user uname
	      File is owned by user uname (numeric user ID allowed).

       -xtype c
	      The  same as -type unless the file is a symbolic link.  For sym-
	      bolic links: if -follow has not been given, true if the file  is
	      a link to a file of type c; if -follow has been given, true if c
	      is `l'.  In other words, for symbolic links, -xtype  checks  the
	      type of the file that -type does not check.

   ACTIONS
       -exec command ;
	      Execute  command;	 true  if 0 status is returned.	 All following
	      arguments to find are taken to be arguments to the command until
	      an  argument  consisting of `;' is encountered.  The string `{}'
	      is replaced by the current file name being processed  everywhere
	      it occurs in the arguments to the command, not just in arguments
	      where it is alone, as in some versions of find.  Both  of	 these
	      constructions might need to be escaped (with a `\') or quoted to
	      protect them from expansion by the shell.	 The command  is  exe-
	      cuted in the starting directory.

       -fls file
	      True; like -ls but write to file like -fprint.

       -fprint file
	      True; print the full file name into file file.  If file does not
	      exist when find is run, it is created; if it does exist,	it  is
	      truncated.   The	file names ``/dev/stdout'' and ``/dev/stderr''
	      are handled specially; they refer to  the	 standard  output  and
	      standard error output, respectively.

       -fprint0 file
	      True; like -print0 but write to file like -fprint.

       -fprintf file format
	      True; like -printf but write to file like -fprint.

       -ok command ;
	      Like  -exec  but	ask the user first (on the standard input); if
	      the response does not start with `y' or `Y', do not run the com-
	      mand, and return false.

       -print True;  print the full file name on the standard output, followed
	      by a newline.

       -print0
	      True; print the full file name on the standard output,  followed
	      by  a  null character.  This allows file names that contain new-
	      lines to be correctly interpreted by programs that  process  the
	      find output.

       -printf format
	      True;  print  format  on	the  standard output, interpreting `\'
	      escapes and `%' directives.  Field widths and precisions can  be
	      specified	 as  with  the	`printf'  C  function.	Unlike -print,
	      -printf does not add a newline at the end of  the	 string.   The
	      escapes and directives are:

	      \a     Alarm bell.

	      \b     Backspace.

	      \c     Stop  printing from this format immediately and flush the
		     output.

	      \f     Form feed.

	      \n     Newline.

	      \r     Carriage return.

	      \t     Horizontal tab.

	      \v     Vertical tab.

	      \\     A literal backslash (`\').

	      \NNN   The character whose ASCII code is NNN (octal).

	      A `\' character followed by any other character is treated as an
	      ordinary character, so they both are printed.

	      %%     A literal percent sign.

	      %a     File's  last  access time in the format returned by the C
		     `ctime' function.

	      %Ak    File's last access time in the  format  specified	by  k,
		     which  is	either `@' or a directive for the C `strftime'
		     function.	The possible values for k  are	listed	below;
		     some  of  them might not be available on all systems, due
		     to differences in `strftime' between systems.
