    "## OVERVIEW\n",
    "\n",
    "**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** is a field of AI concerned with understanding, analyzing and using natural languages. This field is considered a difficult yet intriguing field of study, since it is connected to how humans and their languages work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applications of the field include translation, speech recognition, topic segmentation, information extraction and retrieval, and a lot more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we take a look at some algorithms in the field. Before we get right into it though, we will take a look at a very useful form of language, **context-free** languages. Even though they are a bit restrictive, they have been used a lot in research in natural language processing."

    "## LANGUAGES\n",
    "\n",
    "Languages can be represented by a set of grammar rules over a lexicon of words. Different languages can be represented by different types of grammar, but in Natural Language Processing we are mainly interested in context-free grammars.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context-Free Grammars\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of natural and programming languages can be represented by a **Context-Free Grammar (CFG)**. A CFG is a grammar that has a single non-terminal symbol on the left-hand side. That means a non-terminal can be replaced by the right-hand side of the rule regardless of context. An example of a CFG:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "S -> aSb | ε\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That means `S` can be replaced by either `aSb` or `ε` (with `ε` we denote the empty string). The lexicon of the language is comprised of the terminals `a` and `b`, while with `S` we denote the non-terminal symbol. In general, non-terminals are capitalized while terminals are not, and we usually name the starting non-terminal `S`. The language generated by the above grammar is the language a<sup>n</sup>b<sup>n</sup> for n greater or equal than 1."

    "### Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar\n",
    "\n",
    "While a simple CFG can be very useful, we might want to know the chance of each rule occurring. Above, we do not know if `S` is more likely to be replaced by `aSb` or `ε`. **Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars (PCFG)** are built to fill exactly that need. Each rule has a probability, given in brackets, and the probabilities of a rule sum up to 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "S -> aSb [0.7] | ε [0.3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we know it is more likely for `S` to be replaced by `aSb` than by `ε`.\n",
    "\n",
    "An issue with *PCFGs* is how we will assign the various probabilities to the rules. We could use our knowledge as humans to assign the probabilities, but that is a laborious and prone to error task. Instead, we can *learn* the probabilities from data. Data is categorized as labeled (with correctly parsed sentences, usually called a **treebank**) or unlabeled (given only lexical and syntactic category names).\n",
    "\n",
    "With labeled data, we can simply count the occurrences. For the above grammar, if we have 100 `S` rules and 30 of them are of the form `S -> ε`, we assign a probability of 0.3 to the transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "With unlabeled data we have to learn both the grammar rules and the probability of each rule. We can go with many approaches, one of them the **inside-outside** algorithm. It uses a dynamic programming approach, that first finds the probability of a substring being generated by each rule, and then estimates the probability of each rule."

    "* `A -> a`\n",
    "* `S -> ε`\n",

Note that there can be multiple rules for each left hand side non-terminal, as long they follow the above. For example, a rule for *X* might be: `X -> Y Z | A B | a | b`.\n",

    "### Lexicon\n",
    "\n",
    "The lexicon of a language is defined as a list of allowable words. These words are grouped into the usual classes: `verbs`, `nouns`, `adjectives`, `adverbs`, `pronouns`, `names`, `articles`, `prepositions` and `conjunctions`. For the first five classes it is impossible to list all words, since words are continuously being added in the classes. Recently \"google\" was added to the list of verbs, and words like that will continue to pop up and get added to the lists. For that reason, these first five categories are called **open classes**. The rest of the categories have much fewer words and much less development. While words like \"thou\" were commonly used in the past but have declined almost completely in usage, most changes take many decades or centuries to manifest, so we can safely assume the categories will remain static for the foreseeable future. Thus, these categories are called **closed classes**.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search** (or HITS for short) is an algorithm for information retrieval and page ranking. You can read more on information retrieval in the [text notebook](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python/blob/master/text.ipynb). Essentially, given a collection of documents and a user's query, such systems return to the user the documents most relevant to what the user needs. The HITS algorithm differs from a lot of other similar ranking algorithms (like Google's *Pagerank*) as the page ratings in this algorithm are dependent on the given query. This means that for each new query the result pages must be computed anew. This cost might be prohibitive for many modern search engines, so a lot steer away from this approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "HITS first finds a list of relevant pages to the query and then adds pages that link to or are linked from these pages. Once the set is built, we define two values for each page. **Authority** on the query, the degree of pages from the relevant set linking to it and **hub** of the query, the degree that it points to authoritative pages in the set. Since we do not want to simply count the number of links from a page to other pages, but we also want to take into account the quality of the linked pages, we update the hub and authority values of a page in the following manner, until convergence:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Hub score = The sum of the authority scores of the pages it links to.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Authority score = The sum of hub scores of the pages it is linked from.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the higher quality the pages a page is linked to and from, the higher its scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then normalize the scores by dividing each score by the sum of the squares of the respective scores of all pages. When the values converge, we return the top-valued pages. Note that because we normalize the values, the algorithm is guaranteed to converge."

    "## QUESTION ANSWERING\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question Answering** is a type of Information Retrieval system, where we have a question instead of a query and instead of relevant documents we want the computer to return a short sentence, phrase or word that answers our question. To better understand the concept of question answering systems, you can first read the \"Text Models\" and \"Information Retrieval\" section from the [text notebook](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python/blob/master/text.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical example of such a system is `AskMSR` (Banko *et al.*, 2002), a system for question answering that performed admirably against more sophisticated algorithms. The basic idea behind it is that a lot of questions have already been answered in the web numerous times. The system doesn't know a lot about verbs, or concepts or even what a noun is. It knows about 15 different types of questions and how they can be written as queries. It can rewrite [Who was George Washington's second in command?] as the query [\\* was George Washington's second in command] or [George Washington's second in command was \\*].\n",
    "\n",
    "After rewriting the questions, it issues these queries and retrieves the short text around the query terms. It then breaks the result into 1, 2 or 3-grams. Filters are also applied to increase the chances of a correct answer. If the query starts with \"who\", we filter for names, if it starts with \"how many\" we filter for numbers and so on. We can also filter out the words appearing in the query. For the above query, the answer \"George Washington\" is wrong, even though it is quite possible the 2-gram would appear a lot around the query terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the different results are weighted by the generality of the queries. The result from the general boolean query [George Washington OR second in command] weighs less that the more specific query [George Washington's second in command was \\*]. As an answer we return the most highly-ranked n-gram."

    "## CYK PARSE\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntactic analysis (or **parsing**) of a sentence is the process of uncovering the phrase structure of the sentence according to the rules of a grammar. There are two main approaches to parsing. *Top-down*, start with the starting symbol and build a parse tree with the given words as its leaves, and *bottom-up*, where we start from the given words and build a tree that has the starting symbol as its root. Both approaches involve \"guessing\" ahead, so it is very possible it will take long to parse a sentence (wrong guess mean a lot of backtracking). Thankfully, a lot of effort is spent in analyzing already analyzed substrings, so we can follow a dynamic programming approach to store and reuse these parses instead of recomputing them. The *CYK Parsing Algorithm* (named after its inventors, Cocke, Younger and Kasami) utilizes this technique to parse sentences of a grammar in *Chomsky Normal Form*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CYK algorithm returns an *M x N x N* array (named *P*), where *N* is the number of words in the sentence and *M* the number of non-terminal symbols in the grammar. Each element in this array shows the probability of a substring being transformed from a particular non-terminal. To find the most probable parse of the sentence, a search in the resulting array is required. Search heuristic algorithms work well in this space, and we can derive the heuristics from the properties of the grammar.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm in short works like this: There is an external loop that determines the length of the substring. Then the algorithm loops through the words in the sentence. For each word, it again loops through all the words to its right up to the first-loop length. The substring it will work on in this iteration is the words from the second-loop word with first-loop length. Finally, it loops through all the rules in the grammar and updates the substring's probability for each right-hand side non-terminal."

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation takes as input a list of words and a probabilistic grammar (from the `ProbGrammar` class detailed above) in CNF and returns the table/dictionary *P*. An item's key in *P* is a tuple in the form `(Non-terminal, start of substring, length of substring)`, and the value is a probability. For example, for the sentence \"the monkey is dancing\" and the substring \"the monkey\" an item can be `('NP', 0, 2): 0.5`, which means the first two words (the substring from index 0 and length 2) have a 0.5 probablity of coming from the `NP` terminal.\n",

    "## CHART PARSING\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now take a look at a more general chart parsing algorithm. Given a non-probabilistic grammar and a sentence, this algorithm builds a parse tree in a top-down manner, with the words of the sentence as the leaves. It works with a dynamic programming approach, building a chart to store parses for substrings so that it doesn't have to analyze them again (just like the CYK algorithm). Each non-terminal, starting from S, gets replaced by its right-hand side rules in the chart, until we end up with the correct parses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "A parse is in the form `[start, end, non-terminal, sub-tree, expected-transformation]`, where `sub-tree` is a tree with the corresponding `non-terminal` as its root and `expected-transformation` is a right-hand side rule of the `non-terminal`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chart parsing is implemented in a class, `Chart`. It is initialized with a grammar and can return the list of all the parses of a sentence with the `parses` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chart is a list of lists. The lists correspond to the lengths of substrings (including the empty string), from start to finish. When we say 'a point in the chart', we refer to a list of a certain length.\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick rundown of the class functions:"

   "source": [
    "* `parses`: Returns a list of parses for a given sentence. If the sentence can't be parsed, it will return an empty list. Initializes the process by calling `parse` from the starting symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `parse`: Parses the list of words and builds the chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `add_edge`: Adds another edge to the chart at a given point. Also, examines whether the edge extends or predicts another edge. If the edge itself is not expecting a transformation, it will extend other edges and it will predict edges otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `scanner`: Given a word and a point in the chart, it extends edges that were expecting a transformation that can result in the given word. For example, if the word 'the' is an 'Article' and we are examining two edges at a chart's point, with one expecting an 'Article' and the other a 'Verb', the first one will be extended while the second one will not.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `predictor`: If an edge can't extend other edges (because it is expecting a transformation itself), we will add to the chart rules/transformations that can help extend the edge. The new edges come from the right-hand side of the expected transformation's rules. For example, if an edge is expecting the transformation 'Adjective Noun', we will add to the chart an edge for each right-hand side rule of the non-terminal 'Adjective'.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `extender`: Extends edges given an edge (called `E`). If `E`'s non-terminal is the same as the expected transformation of another edge (let's call it `A`), add to the chart a new edge with the non-terminal of `A` and the transformations of `A` minus the non-terminal that matched with `E`'s non-terminal. For example, if an edge `E` has 'Article' as its non-terminal and is expecting no transformation, we need to see what edges it can extend. Let's examine the edge `N`. This expects a transformation of 'Noun Verb'. 'Noun' does not match with 'Article', so we move on. Another edge, `A`, expects a transformation of 'Article Noun' and has a non-terminal of 'NP'. We have a match! A new edge will be added with 'NP' as its non-terminal (the non-terminal of `A`) and 'Noun' as the expected transformation (the rest of the expected transformation of `A`)."
