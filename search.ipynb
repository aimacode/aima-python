Broadly, search algorithms are classified into two types:\n",

    "\n",
    "Before we solve problems using the genetic algorithm, we will explain how to intuitively understand the algorithm using a trivial example.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generating Phrases\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, we use a genetic algorithm to generate a particular target phrase from a population of random strings. This is a classic example that helps build intuition about how to use this algorithm in other problems as well. Before we break the problem down, let us try to brute force the solution. Let us say that we want to generate the phrase \"genetic algorithm\". The phrase is 17 characters long. We can use any character from the 26 lowercase characters and the space character. To generate a random phrase of length 17, each space can be filled in 27 ways. So the total number of possible phrases is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 27^{17} = 2153693963075557766310747 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is a massive number. If we wanted to generate the phrase \"Genetic Algorithm\", we would also have to include all the 26 uppercase characters into consideration thereby increasing the sample space from 27 characters to 53 characters and the total number of possible phrases then would be\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 53^{17} = 205442259656281392806087233013 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wanted to include punctuations and numerals into the sample space, we would have further complicated an already impossible problem. Hence, brute forcing is not an option. Now we'll apply the genetic algorithm and see how it significantly reduces the search space. We essentially want to *evolve* our population of random strings so that they better approximate the target phrase as the number of generations increase. Genetic algorithms work on the principle of Darwinian Natural Selection according to which, there are three key concepts that need to be in place for evolution to happen. They are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Heredity**: There must be a process in place by which children receive the properties of their parents. <br> \n",
    "For this particular problem, two strings from the population will be chosen as parents and will be split at a random index and recombined as described in the `recombine` function to create a child. This child string will then be added to the new generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Variation**: There must be a variety of traits present in the population or a means with which to introduce variation. <br>If there is no variation in the sample space, we might never reach the global optimum. To ensure that there is enough variation, we can initialize a large population, but this gets computationally expensive as the population gets larger. Hence, we often use another method called mutation. In this method, we randomly change one or more characters of some strings in the population based on a predefined probability value called the mutation rate or mutation probability as described in the `mutate` function. The mutation rate is usually kept quite low. A mutation rate of zero fails to introduce variation in the population and a high mutation rate (say 50%) is as good as a coin flip and the population fails to benefit from the previous recombinations. An optimum balance has to be maintained between population size and mutation rate so as to reduce the computational cost as well as have sufficient variation in the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Selection**: There must be some mechanism by which some members of the population have the opportunity to be parents and pass down their genetic information and some do not. This is typically referred to as \"survival of the fittest\". <br>\n",
    "There has to be some way of determining which phrases in our population have a better chance of eventually evolving into the target phrase. This is done by introducing a fitness function that calculates how close the generated phrase is to the target phrase. The function will simply return a scalar value corresponding to the number of matching characters between the generated phrase and the target phrase."

    "First we will take on the simpler problem of coloring a small graph with two colors. Before we do anything, let's imagine how a solution might look. First, we have to represent our colors. Say, 'R' for red and 'G' for green. These make up our gene pool. What of the individual solutions though? For that, we will look at our problem. We stated we have a graph. A graph has nodes and edges, and we want to color the nodes. Naturally, we want to store each node's color. If we have four nodes, we can store their colors in a list of genes, one for each node. A possible solution will then look like this: ['R', 'R', 'G', 'R']. In the general case, we will represent each solution with a list of chars ('R' and 'G'), with length the number of nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we need to come up with a fitness function that appropriately scores individuals. Again, we will look at the problem definition at hand. We want to color a graph. For a solution to be optimal, no edge should connect two nodes of the same color. How can we use this information to score a solution? A naive (and ineffective) approach would be to count the different colors in the string. So ['R', 'R', 'R', 'R'] has a score of 1 and ['R', 'R', 'G', 'G'] has a score of 2. Why that fitness function is not ideal though? Why, we forgot the information about the edges! The edges are pivotal to the problem and the above function only deals with node colors. We didn't use all the information at hand and ended up with an ineffective answer. How, then, can we use that information to our advantage?\n",

    "First we need to think about the representation of each solution. We can go the naive route of representing the whole chessboard with the queens' placements on it. That is definitely one way to go about it, but for the purpose of this tutorial we will do something different. We have eight queens, so we will have a gene for each of them. The gene pool will be numbers from 0 to 7, for the different columns. The *position* of the gene in the state will denote the row the particular queen is placed in.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can have the state \"03304577\". Here the first gene with a value of 0 means \"the queen at row 0 is placed at column 0\", for the second gene \"the queen at row 1 is placed at column 3\" and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now need to think about the fitness function. On the graph coloring problem we counted the valid edges. The same thought process can be applied here. Instead of edges though, we have positioning between queens. If two queens are not threatening each other, we say they are at a \"non-attacking\" positioning. We can, therefore, count how many such positionings are there.\n",

    "Next we need to write our fitness function. Remember, queens threaten each other if they are at the same row, column or diagonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since positionings are mutual, we must take care not to count them twice. Therefore for each queen, we will only check for conflicts for the queens after her.\n",
    "\n",
    "A gene's value in an individual `q` denotes the queen's column, and the position of the gene denotes its row. We can check if the aforementioned values between two genes are the same. We also need to check for diagonals. A queen *a* is in the diagonal of another queen, *b*, if the difference of the rows between them is equal to either their difference in columns (for the diagonal on the right of *a*) or equal to the negative difference of their columns (for the left diagonal of *a*). Below is given the fitness function."
