Map:
+10 for having breadth-first have a better solution, in terms of cost, than depth-first.
+10 for having uniform-cost have a better solution, in terms of cost, than breadth-first.

My Problem Instance:
+10 for a state space with at least 50 states. The big puzzle has 7 empty squares, with 3 possible states each. 3^7 = 2187 possible problem states.
+10: An instance that yields a better solution with BFS than DFS. In the 4 steps instance of One Two Three, BFS runs better than DFS.
+10: UCS finds a solution at least 1 move deep. The 1 step instance finds the goal using UCS in 1 step.
+10: UCS finds a solution at least 2 moves deep. The 4 steps instance finds the goal using UCS in 2 steps.
+10: UCS finds a solution at least 4 moves deep. The 4 steps instance finds the goal in 4 steps.
+10: The heuristic runs without exceptions, and generates interesting output for, BestFS and A*.
The output is interesting in that it actually is making more nodes be generated than with the simplest heuristic applied, like in light switch.
This is probably due to the fact that the heuristic is imperfect, and it needs to check for groupings of numbers rather than just what is next to the square.
