    "The class `PropKB` can be used to represent a knowledge base of propositional logic sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that the class `KB` has four methods, apart from `__init__`. A point to note here: the `ask` method simply calls the `ask_generator` method. Thus, this one has already been implemented and what you'll have to actually implement when you create your own knowledge base class (if you want to, though I doubt you'll ever need to; just use the ones we've created for you), will be the `ask_generator` function and not the `ask` function itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class `PropKB` now.\n",
    "* `__init__(self, sentence=None)` : The constructor `__init__` creates a single field `clauses` which will be a list of all the sentences of the knowledge base. Note that each one of these sentences will be a 'clause' i.e. a sentence which is made up of only literals and `or`s.\n",
    "* `tell(self, sentence)` : When you want to add a sentence to the KB, you use the `tell` method. This method takes a sentence, converts it to its CNF, extracts all the clauses, and adds all these clauses to the `clauses` field. So, you need not worry about `tell`ing only clauses to the knowledge base. You can `tell` the knowledge base a sentence in any form that you wish; converting it to CNF and adding the resulting clauses will be handled by the `tell` method.\n",
    "* `ask_generator(self, query)` : The `ask_generator` function is used by the `ask` function. It calls the `tt_entails` function, which in turn returns `True` if the knowledge base entails query and `False` otherwise. The `ask_generator` itself returns an empty dict `{}` if the knowledge base entails query and `None` otherwise. This might seem a little bit weird to you. After all, it makes more sense just to return a `True` or a `False` instead of the `{}` or `None` But this is done to maintain consistency with the way things are in First-Order Logic, where, an `ask_generator` function, is supposed to return all the substitutions that make the query true. Hence the dict, to return all these substitutions. I will be mostly be using the `ask` function which returns a `{}` or a `False`, but if you don't like this, you can always use the `ask_if_true` function which returns a `True` or a `False`.\n",
    "* `retract(self, sentence)` : This function removes all the clauses of the sentence given, from the knowledge base. Like the `tell` function, you don't have to pass clauses to remove them from the knowledge base; any sentence will do fine. The function will take care of converting that sentence to clauses and then remove those."

    "Looking at Figure 7.9 we see that in all models in which the knowledge base is `True`, $P_{1, 1}$ is `False`. It makes sense that `ask_if_true()` returns `True` for $\\alpha = \\neg P_{1, 1}$ and `False` for $\\alpha = P_{1, 1}$. This begs the question, what if $\\alpha$ is `True` in only a portion of all models. Do we return `True` or `False`? This doesn't rule out the possibility of $\\alpha$ being `True` but it is not entailed by the `KB` so we return `False` in such cases. We can see this is the case for $P_{2, 2}$ and $P_{3, 1}$."

    "### Proof by Resolution\n",
    "Recall that our goal is to check whether $\\text{KB} \\vDash \\alpha$ i.e. is $\\text{KB} \\implies \\alpha$ true in every model. Suppose we wanted to check if $P \\implies Q$ is valid. We check the satisfiability of $\\neg (P \\implies Q)$, which can be rewritten as $P \\land \\neg Q$. If $P \\land \\neg Q$ is unsatisfiable, then $P \\implies Q$ must be true in all models. This gives us the result \"$\\text{KB} \\vDash \\alpha$ <em>if and only if</em> $\\text{KB} \\land \\neg \\alpha$ is unsatisfiable\".<br/>\n",
    "This technique corresponds to <em>proof by <strong>contradiction</strong></em>, a standard mathematical proof technique. We assume $\\alpha$ to be false and show that this leads to a contradiction with known axioms in $\\text{KB}$. We obtain a contradiction by making valid inferences using inference rules. In this proof we use a single inference rule, <strong>resolution</strong> which states $(l_1 \\lor \\dots \\lor l_k) \\land (m_1 \\lor \\dots \\lor m_n) \\land (l_i \\iff \\neg m_j) \\implies l_1 \\lor \\dots \\lor l_{i - 1} \\lor l_{i + 1} \\lor \\dots \\lor l_k \\lor m_1 \\lor \\dots \\lor m_{j - 1} \\lor m_{j + 1} \\lor \\dots \\lor m_n$. Applying the resolution yeilds us a clause which we add to the KB. We keep doing this until:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>There are no new clauses that can be added, in which case $\\text{KB} \\nvDash \\alpha$.</li>\n",
    "<li>Two clauses resolve to yield the <em>empty clause</em>, in which case $\\text{KB} \\vDash \\alpha$.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "The <em>empty clause</em> is equivalent to <em>False</em> because it arises only from resolving two complementary\n",
    "unit clauses such as $P$ and $\\neg P$ which is a contradiction as both $P$ and $\\neg P$ can't be <em>True</em> at the same time."
