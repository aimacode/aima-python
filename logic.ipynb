We'll be covering two types of knowledge bases, `PropKB` - Propositional logic knowledge base and `FolKB` - First order logic knowledge base.

    "The class `PropKB` can be used to represent a knowledge base of propositional logic sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that the class `KB` has four methods, apart from `__init__`. A point to note here: the `ask` method simply calls the `ask_generator` method. Thus, this one has already been implemented and what you'll have to actually implement when you create your own knowledge base class (if you want to, though I doubt you'll ever need to; just use the ones we've created for you), will be the `ask_generator` function and not the `ask` function itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class `PropKB` now.\n",
    "* `__init__(self, sentence=None)` : The constructor `__init__` creates a single field `clauses` which will be a list of all the sentences of the knowledge base. Note that each one of these sentences will be a 'clause' i.e. a sentence which is made up of only literals and `or`s.\n",
    "* `tell(self, sentence)` : When you want to add a sentence to the KB, you use the `tell` method. This method takes a sentence, converts it to its CNF, extracts all the clauses, and adds all these clauses to the `clauses` field. So, you need not worry about `tell`ing only clauses to the knowledge base. You can `tell` the knowledge base a sentence in any form that you wish; converting it to CNF and adding the resulting clauses will be handled by the `tell` method.\n",
    "* `ask_generator(self, query)` : The `ask_generator` function is used by the `ask` function. It calls the `tt_entails` function, which in turn returns `True` if the knowledge base entails query and `False` otherwise. The `ask_generator` itself returns an empty dict `{}` if the knowledge base entails query and `None` otherwise. This might seem a little bit weird to you. After all, it makes more sense just to return a `True` or a `False` instead of the `{}` or `None` But this is done to maintain consistency with the way things are in First-Order Logic, where, an `ask_generator` function, is supposed to return all the substitutions that make the query true. Hence the dict, to return all these substitutions. I will be mostly be using the `ask` function which returns a `{}` or a `False`, but if you don't like this, you can always use the `ask_if_true` function which returns a `True` or a `False`.\n",
    "* `retract(self, sentence)` : This function removes all the clauses of the sentence given, from the knowledge base. Like the `tell` function, you don't have to pass clauses to remove them from the knowledge base; any sentence will do fine. The function will take care of converting that sentence to clauses and then remove those."

It makes sense that `ask_if_true()` returns `True` for $\\alpha = \\neg P_{1, 1}$ and `False` for $\\alpha = P_{1, 1}$. This begs the question, what if $\\alpha$ is `True` in only a portion of all models. Do we return `True` or `False`? This doesn't rule out the possibility of $\\alpha$ being `True` but it is not entailed by the `KB` so we return `False` in such cases. We can see this is the case for $P_{2, 2}$ and $P_{3, 1}$."

    "Recall that our goal is to check whether $\\text{KB} \\vDash \\alpha$ i.e. is $\\text{KB} \\implies \\alpha$ true in every model. Suppose we wanted to check if $P \\implies Q$ is valid. We check the satisfiability of $\\neg (P \\implies Q)$, which can be rewritten as $P \\land \\neg Q$. If $P \\land \\neg Q$ is unsatisfiable, then $P \\implies Q$ must be true in all models. This gives us the result \"$\\text{KB} \\vDash \\alpha$ <em>if and only if</em> $\\text{KB} \\land \\neg \\alpha$ is unsatisfiable\".<br/>\n",
    "This technique corresponds to <em>proof by <strong>contradiction</strong></em>, a standard mathematical proof technique. We assume $\\alpha$ to be false and show that this leads to a contradiction with known axioms in $\\text{KB}$. We obtain a contradiction by making valid inferences using inference rules. In this proof we use a single inference rule, <strong>resolution</strong> which states $(l_1 \\lor \\dots \\lor l_k) \\land (m_1 \\lor \\dots \\lor m_n) \\land (l_i \\iff \\neg m_j) \\implies l_1 \\lor \\dots \\lor l_{i - 1} \\lor l_{i + 1} \\lor \\dots \\lor l_k \\lor m_1 \\lor \\dots \\lor m_{j - 1} \\lor m_{j + 1} \\lor \\dots \\lor m_n$.

But if the right-hand-side is a string, then the string is taken to be an operator, and we create a node in the abstract syntax tree corresponding to a partially-filled  `Expr`, one where we know the left-hand-side is `P` and the operator is `==>`, but we don't yet know the right-hand-side.\n",
