    "But what if we want to model a process with two or more state variables?\n",

    "We do this because carrying out inference on HMMs have standard optimized algorithms.\n",

    "In the domain of robotics, particle filtering is used for _robot localization_.\n",
    "__Localization__ is the problem of finding out where things are, in this case, we want to find the position of a robot in a continuous state space.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "__Monte Carlo Localization__ is an algorithm for robots to _localize_ using a _particle filter_.\n",
    "Given a map of the environment, the algorithm estimates the position and orientation of a robot as it moves and senses the environment.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Initially, particles are distributed uniformly over the state space, ie the robot has no information of where it is and assumes it is equally likely to be at any point in space.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "When the robot moves, it analyses the incoming evidence to shift and change the probability to better approximate the probability distribution of its position.\n",
    "The particles are then resampled based on their weights.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Gradually, as more evidence comes in, the robot gets better at approximating its location and the particles converge towards the actual position of the robot.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The pose of a robot is defined by its two Cartesian coordinates with values $x$ and $y$ and its direction with value $\\theta$.\n",
    "We use the kinematic equations of motion to model a deterministic state prediction.\n",
    "This is our motion model (or transition model).\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Next, we need a sensor model.\n",
    "There can be two kinds of sensor models, the first assumes that the sensors detect _stable_, _recognizable_ features of the environment called __landmarks__.\n",
    "The robot senses the location and bearing of each landmark and updates its belief according to that.\n",
    "We can also assume the noise in measurements to be Gaussian, to simplify things.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Another kind of sensor model is used for an array of range sensors, each of which has a fixed bearing relative to the robot.\n",
    "These sensors provide a set of range values in each direction.\n",
    "This will also be corrupted by Gaussian noise, but we can assume that the errors for different beam directions are independent and identically distributed.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "After evidence comes in, the robot updates its belief state and reweights the particle distribution to better aproximate the actual distribution.\n",
