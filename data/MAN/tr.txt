NAME
       tr - translate or delete characters

SYNOPSIS
       tr [OPTION]... SET1 [SET2]

DESCRIPTION
       Translate, squeeze, and/or delete characters from standard
       input, writing to standard output.

       -c, --complement
	      first complement SET1

       -d, --delete
	      delete characters in SET1, do not translate

       -s, --squeeze-repeats
	      replace each input sequence of a repeated character
	      that  is listed in SET1 with a single occurrence of
	      that character

       -t, --truncate-set1
	      first truncate SET1 to length of SET2

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
	      output version information and exit

       SETs are specified as strings of characters.  Most  repre-
       sent themselves.	 Interpreted sequences are:

       \NNN   character	 with  octal value NNN (1 to 3 octal dig-
	      its)

       \\     backslash

       \a     audible BEL

       \b     backspace

       \f     form feed

       \n     new line

       \r     return

       \t     horizontal tab

       \v     vertical tab

       CHAR1-CHAR2
	      all characters from CHAR1	 to  CHAR2  in	ascending
	      order

       [CHAR*]
	      in SET2, copies of CHAR until length of SET1

       [CHAR*REPEAT]
	      REPEAT  copies  of  CHAR,	 REPEAT octal if starting
	      with 0

       [:alnum:]
	      all letters and digits

       [:alpha:]
	      all letters

       [:blank:]
	      all horizontal whitespace

       [:cntrl:]
	      all control characters

       [:digit:]
	      all digits

       [:graph:]
	      all printable characters, not including space

       [:lower:]
	      all lower case letters

       [:print:]
	      all printable characters, including space

       [:punct:]
	      all punctuation characters

       [:space:]
	      all horizontal or vertical whitespace

       [:upper:]
	      all upper case letters

       [:xdigit:]
	      all hexadecimal digits

       [=CHAR=]
	      all characters which are equivalent to CHAR

       Translation occurs if -d is not given and  both	SET1  and
       SET2  appear.  -t may be used only when translating.  SET2
       is extended to length of SET1 by repeating its last  char-
       acter   as  necessary.	Excess	characters  of	SET2  are
       ignored.	 Only [:lower:] and [:upper:] are  guaranteed  to
       expand in ascending order; used in SET2 while translating,
       they may only be used in pairs to specify case conversion.
       -s uses SET1 if not translating nor deleting; else squeez-
       ing uses SET2 and occurs after translation or deletion.
