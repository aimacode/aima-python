NAME
     more - file perusal filter for crt viewing

SYNOPSIS
     more [-dlfpcsu] [-num] [+/ pattern] [+ linenum] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     More is a filter for paging through text one screenful at a time.	This
     version is especially primitve.  Users should realize that less(1) pro-
     vides more(1) emulation and extensive enhancements.

OPTIONS
     Command line options are described below.	Options are also taken from
     the environment variable MORE (make sure to precede them with a dash
     (``-'')) but command line options will override them.

     -num  This option specifies an integer which is the screen size (in
	   lines).

     -d	   more will prompt the user with the message "[Press space to con-
	   tinue, 'q' to quit.]" and will display "[Press 'h' for instruc-
	   tions.]" instead of ringing the bell when an illegal key is
	   pressed.

     -l	   more usually treats ^L (form feed) as a special character, and will
	   pause after any line that contains a form feed.  The -l option will
	   prevent this behavior.

     -f	   Causes more to count logical, rather than screen lines (i.e., long
	   lines are not folded).

     -p	   Do not scroll.  Instead, clear the whole screen and then display
	   the text.

     -c	   Do not scroll.  Instead, paint each screen from the top, clearing
	   the remainder of each line as it is displayed.

     -s	   Squeeze multiple blank lines into one.

     -u	   Suppress underlining.

     +/	   The +/ option specifies a string that will be searched for before
	   each file is displayed.

     +num  Start at line number num.

COMMANDS
     Interactive commands for more are based on vi(1).	Some commands may be
     preceded by a decimal number, called k in the descriptions below.	In the
     following descriptions, ^X means control-X.

     h or ?	 Help: display a summary of these commands.  If you forget all
		 the other commands, remember this one.

     SPACE	 Display next k lines of text.	Defaults to current screen
		 size.

     z		 Display next k lines of text.	Defaults to current screen
		 size.	Argument becomes new default.

     RETURN	 Display next k lines of text.	Defaults to 1.	Argument
		 becomes new default.

     d or ^D	 Scroll k lines.  Default is current scroll size, initially
		 11.  Argument becomes new default.

     q or Q or INTERRUPT
		 Exit.

     s		 Skip forward k lines of text.	Defaults to 1.

     f		 Skip forward k screenfuls of text.  Defaults to 1.

     b or ^B	 Skip backwards k screenfuls of text.  Defaults to 1.  Only
		 works with files, not pipes.

     '		 Go to place where previous search started.

     =		 Display current line number.

     /pattern	 Search for kth occurrence of regular expression.  Defaults to
		 1.

     n		 Search for kth occurrence of last r.e.	 Defaults to 1.

     !<cmd> or :!<cmd>
		 Execute <cmd> in a subshell

     v		 Start up an editor at current line.  The editor is taken from
		 the environment variable VISUAL if defined, or EDITOR if
		 VISUAL is not defined, or defaults to "vi" if neither VISUAL
		 nor EDITOR is defined.

     ^L		 Redraw screen

     :n		 Go to kth next file.  Defaults to 1.

     :p		 Go to kth previous file.  Defaults to 1.

     :f		 Display current file name and line number

     .		 Repeat previous command

ENVIRONMENT
     More utilizes the following environment variables, if they exist:

     MORE	 This variable may be set with favored options to more.

     SHELL	 Current shell in use (normally set by the shell at login
		 time).

     TERM	 Specifies terminal type, used by more to get the terminal
		 characteristics necessary to manipulate the screen.

HISTORY
     The more command appeared in 3.0BSD.  This man page documents more ver-
     sion 5.19 (Berkeley 6/29/88), which is currently in use in the Linux com-
     munity.  Documentation was produced using several other versions of the
     man page, and extensive inspection of the source code.
